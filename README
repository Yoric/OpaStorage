A simple key-value store built in Opa.

Keys and values are stored as strings.

Public API:
* POST some_key   => adds [(some_key, body)] to the storage.
* GET  some_key   => if [(some_key, some_body)] appears in the storage, return [some_body] as text/plain, otherwise 404 (Not found)
* DELETE some_key => if [(some_key, some_body)] appears in the storage, delete it, otherwise ignored
* everything else => 405 (Method not allowed)
